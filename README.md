### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dave!

I'm currently pursuing my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Statistics at Carleton University. In my spare time, I like to adventure (climb, ski, backpack, travel... basically anything outside really), read, code, watch John Oliver, and dabble in photography.

I'm currently learning more about AI and ML, and am hoping to start dipping into some Kaggle competitions and hackathons!
